a couple of images showed are erosion fractals due to rain,other images of  metals and crystals that form fractals , when thinking about fractals, you don't think about rocks or crystals. Crystal,metals and inorganics can form fractals due to external forces and resources. Fractals in theory can grow any size but do not to external forces and limited resources, with creative coding we can explore how far inorganic fractals can grow
